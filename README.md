# Type-2-Diabetes-Prediction
The goal is to predict if a patient is diagonized as Type-2 Diabetes. Dataset file can be accessed [here](https://github.com/ka4on/Type-2-Diabetes-Prediction/tree/main/datasetPracticeFusionDiabetes/datasetPracticeFusionDiabetes). Data Cleaning process is stored in the [HA-HW1-Prep](https://github.com/ka4on/Type-2-Diabetes-Prediction/blob/main/HA-HW1_Prep.ipynb) file. You can check the prediction in the [HA-HW1-Prep](https://github.com/ka4on/Type-2-Diabetes-Prediction/blob/main/HA-HW1.ipynb). The model preformance is measured by [Brier Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) on a seperate test dataset. The model performance is good with a Brier score of 0.179.
